One of the recurring conversations I find myself in is "what games do you think are worth playing?" I've played a LOT of older games, so often this comes up in retro gaming and "what games are good for developers to try" communities.

I never have a list together, so I wanted to get one together. This page is hopefully eventually going to be grouped by several properties. For now, though - just consoles.

## By Console ##

I'm American, so you'll have to translate these consoles to your region. Good luck getting most the games, though.

### Nintendo Entertainment System ###

*Adventures of Lolo* - a puzzle game with some vague relationships to Sokoban.

*Arkanoid* - The best I can tell, the game responsible for powerups in Breakout-style games.

*Balloon Fight* - It's a bit like Joust, but also a bit like the world's clumsiest aeroplane dog fight.

*Bionic Commando* - I don't know why this is here, and I should fix that by actually playing it instead of just meaning to play it.

*Castlevania III* - If you can choose only one classic Castlevania game, this is the one most likely to be finishable and enjoyable. Horror themed platformer.

*Chip n Dale Rescue Rangers* - The Disney Afternoon games on NES are all suprisingly good, and are all worth trying at least.

*Color-A-Dinosaur* - dwangoAC has asserted that this is one of the most underrated games of all time, and should get more love. I'm of the opinion, after multiple looks at it, that he's right - what could be more awesome than coloring a dinosaur - and why don't more people know about this hidden masterpiece of a game?

*Contra* - You're not going to finish this, but at least you'll have a good excuse to remember the Komami Code if you want to try to finish it... and that's basically why so many people have the Konami Code burnt into their brains.

*Crystalis* - It's a bit like Legend of Zelda, if it wasn't Legend of Zelda.

*Darkwing Duck* - The Disney Afternoon games on NES are all suprisingly good, and are all worth trying at least.

*Dr. Mario* - An active puzzle game with some relationships to Columns and Tetris.

*Dragon Warrior* - Or maybe "Dragon Quest" - definitive early RPG series. Really any of the early ones work, but for my money, it's the first one.

*DuckTales* - The Disney Afternoon games on NES are all suprisingly good, and are all worth trying at least.

*Excitebike* - Early bike racing game, perhaps more notable for blown engines and having an early variation on a track editor than anything else.

*Kid Icarus* - It's just... an interesting platformer. About being Icarus.

*Kirby's Adventure* - First game about a pink blob that eats everything in sight. I promise - it makes sense in context.

*The Legend of Zelda* - Iconic action adventure game. It kind of is used to define other games, so it's hard to define in terms of itself. Good to play if only to understand a game that other games are explained in terms of.

*Little Nemo the Dream Master* - platformer that can only be described as being about a little boy's misadventures in the land of dreams, complete with transformations and slightly surreal aspects.

*Maniac Mansion* - Significant point and click adventure game. Probably better to run the original on ScuMMVM but here we are.

*Metroid* - Half of Metrovania, early atmospheric exploration game.

*Monster Party* - A platformer that defies explanation. Kind of like a boss rush platformer where you kinda just run from boss to boss defeating them, where each one has some gimmick or quirky premise. You just have to try it.

*Paperboy* - perhaps best known as the impossible arcade game, but something I think everyone should try at least a few times.

*River City Ransom* - sort of beat-em-up RPG about street gangs.

*Spy Hunter* - Sort of an arcade road racer of sorts. Not a racing game, just a game where you race along a road. Or in a boat. Whatever. Just try it.

*Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles* - as you might guess, a beat-em-up based on TMNT. Both this and the second TMNT are quite iconic to those who owned an NES. It's okay - we all love Donatello, and we all hate the Dam level.

*Tiny Toon Adventures* - Suprisingly good platformer based on the cartoon of the same name.



### Sega Genesis ###

*Boogerman* - platformer of its own color, for sure. I feel Genesis is better than SNES here.

*Castle of Illusion* - Platformer featuring Mickey Mouse. One of the few 16-bit Disney games worth playing, IMHO.

*Columns* - Active puzzle, the first I played of a certain category and a game I've lost countless hours to.

*Crusader of Centy* - Action/RPG-ish like 16-bit Zelda, with enough unique aspects to stand out on its own.

*Earthworm Jim* - like Boogerman above, a platformer all its own color. I never liked it but it would be a disgrace not to list such an original game.

*Fatal Labyrinth* - to me, the definitive 16-bit roguelike game when I was a kid.

*Golden Axe* - influential (and good!) beat-em-up style sidescroller.

*Gunstar Heroes* - Rock solid run and gun shooter.

*Home Alone* - only good version of Home Alone for home consoles I've ever played, lay traps and drive the wet bandits crazy. A unique game. There's far worse ways to spend 15 minutes.

*Kid Chameleon* - another one of those "platformer of its own color" games. Actually a personal favorite, but I've never beaten it without cheating.

*Landstalker: The Treasures of King Nole* - Isometric Action RPG. What I've played is good; unfortunately it just feels like a production to get through this.

*Light Crusader* - Another isometric action RPG. This one actually isn't that bad, and some of the puzzles and events are brilliant.

*Mega Man: The Wily Wars* - to me, the definitive version of Megaman 1-3. If you're going to try Megaman classic, this is the version of 2 to try!

*Monster World IV* - sidescrolling action RPG. Although Wonder Boy in Monster World precedes it, this game really defines itself as its own thing.

*Mortal Kombat 2* - Classic Arcade fighting game. I consider this to be the best home version - but you'll need a six button controller to really enjoy it.

*Mutant League Football* - I hate sports games, but pummeling aliens to death with a skeleton while I try to get a first down on a field that is purple, green, and made of rubbber is an entertainment value that sells itself in my eyes.

*NBA Jam Tournament Edition* - Like Mutant League Football, a unique take on basketball. Far more enjoyable than most sports games to me.

*The Revenge of Shinobi* - I think this is like the second or third game in the series, but an action platformer slash beat-em-up that defined many of my early childhood evenings and an arcade classic I'm sure many people played.

*Rocket Knight Adventures* - Yet another platformer of its own design. What the Genesis lacks in good RPGs it makes up for in good platformers.

*Rolo to the Rescue* - frankly, this game isn't good at all, but it's one of only three games I know of on console that feature an elephant as a main character.

*Shining Force 2* - if you can only pick one of the two Shining Force games, this is the one to pick. Strategy RPG that makes Fire Emblem look pathetic by comparison in my eyes. Also one of my late father's favorite games.

*Sonic 3 and Knuckles* - again, "if I can choose only one". People have been arguing for years about which Sonic game is the best, but S3&K, to me, is where the series peaked. Definitive series of platforming games.

*Street Fighter 2* - there is no bad version of this definitive early fighting game, only "good" and "better" versions. Combo systems in fighting games came from hitstun exploitation in this game!

*Streets of Rage* - definitive early arcade beat 'em up.

*ToeJam and Earl* - Publisher interference ruined JUP's masterpiece of a series, but this is a roguelike-ish game that covers two the story told by two hip-hop aliens who crash landed on earth once they returned home, to Funkotron. Far, far better with a friend.

*Vectorman* - Rock solid shooter/platformer with a unique lead character. Steep difficulty curve. Don't jump straight to 2! It continues the difficulty curve where 1 left off.

*Wonder Boy in Monster World* - Also known as Monster World 3, a sidescrolling RPG game worth playing at least once. Shion is still one of my favorite heroes to this day.

*Zero Wing* - a shmup. Where "All your base" et al came from. Probably the best shmup on the Genesis, all the same.

### Super Nintendo Entertainment System ###

*Breath of Fire* - RPG. Engaging story and unique characters.

*Chrono Trigger* - Another RPG. Uses the iconic ATB. Time travelling shenanigans.

*Donkey Kong Country* - relatively unique platformer.

*Earthbound* - literally THE game that got me into game design. An Eastern take on Western culture, and one of the first RPGs set in modern times. Definitely its own thing.

*EVO: Search for Eden* - early Enix game about evolving to search for Eden? I've never beaten it. It's bad about punishing you - hard - for early mistakes. Still worth trying.

*Final Fantasy VI* - IMHO, best early Final Fantasy game. ATB-based RPG.

*Goof Troop* - Another of the few 16-bit Disney games worth playing. You'll need a second player. Top down action-adventure.

*Kirby Super Star* - solid collection of Kirby games. Platformers with a character who eats just about everything.

*Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past* - a game so fundamental to game history, it's used to explain gameplay styles. Action RPG-ish game.

*Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals* - "If you can only play one". This one is chronologically first anyway. Off-beat RPG.

*Secret of Evermore* - Action RPG on the Secret of Mana engine, homage to pulp sci-fi.

*Secret of Mana* - Action RPG. Better with at least one other player.

*Super Mario All-Stars* - Definitive versions, to me, of Mario 1, Mario 2 JP, Mario 2 USA, and Mario 3. Iconic platformer games.

*Super Mario Kart* - Pretty much the first "real" combat cart racing game.

*Super Mario RPG* - Yes, Mario is just KILLING IT on the SNES. An RPG set in Mario's world that's worth playing even if you normally hate Mario games.

*Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island* - Yes, another Mario game. Relatively unique platformer.

*Super Metroid* - ever heard the term "Metroivania"? This is one half that term. Atmospheric open-worldish action platformer.

*Terranigma* - Action RPG about bringing the world to life.

*Zombies Ate My Neighbors* - Top-down arcade-ish action game. Better with a friend. Another game busy paying homage to campy sci-fi.
