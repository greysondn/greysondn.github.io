title: Mods to Install Alongside Tale of Two Wastelands
permalink: /guide/ttw-mods
---

I'm not tracking my version, but I'm reasonably sure it's 3.x . Let the user beware this is meant for my own use, and you might get hurt.

I'm trying most of this one piece at a time. I'm enjoying this game and don't want to break it.

If you're here hoping that this list will be magical for you, "bad news!". Be aware that much of the initial source of it is copied from the tale of two wastelands community anyway.

Icons
=====
![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw] - Tale of Two Wastelands - mostly means notes came from that community

![Vortex][icon-ttw] - Vortex - means it was installed using Vortex

If vortex icon isn't there, assume you have to install it manually (if I installed it) or I've not even tried (if I haven't installed it/todo/etc). I'm not going to spend three hours looking for a manually installed icon.


Vortex
======
Nexus's Mod Manager. Pretty sure they've consistently warned not to use a mod manager that isn't smart enough to leave files alone. I'm hoping Vortex's rollback features are good enough to save me if I break something.

I'll keep notes on how that goes for me here.

Vortex 0.18.12+ using Fallout: New Vegas support in it, hooked **after** TTW was already installed. Locates the game binary okay, no surprises. NV binary is kept in same place by TTW anyway.

Mods I'm using
==============

Basics
------
Probably wouldn't hurt to install all these first, honestly.

* [JIP LN NVSE Plugin](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277) ![Vortex][icon-ttw] : script extender needed for many plugins
* [MCM - The Mod Configuration Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507) [![Tale of Two Wastelands] ![icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended]![Vortex][icon-ttw] : Adds a menu that can be used to configure compatible mods. (TTW demands Bugfix 2, I'm running whatever Vortex decided it was grabbing which can't have been the right version)
* [NVAC](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635) ![Vortex][icon-ttw][![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended] : New Vegas Anti-Crash, should help stability.
* [UIO - UI Organizer](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57174) ![Vortex][icon-ttw][![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended] : manages UI mods, should prevent some breakage (hopefully)

Specific Prerequisites
----------------------
Things installed only because they were needed for something under this point

* Just Mods Merged 
  * [JohnnyGuitar NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66927) ![Vortex][icon-ttw] : more extra functions for NVSE

Fallout 4 Backporting
---------------------

* [Just Mods Merged](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/67253) 
  * This merges a number ![Vortex][icon-ttw]of mods. You can reconfigure it in MCM.
  * For backporting FO4 features, we only care about:
    * Dynamic Crosshair (I think, I'm not sure, would have to boot FO4)
    * Hit Indicator (Definitely, shows direction you were hit from)
    * Visual Objectives (Definitely, shows actual marker on objective)
* [Loot Menu](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/61723) [![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended] : The realtime loot menu system from FO4

QOL
---
* [CASM with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/45652) [![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended]![Vortex][icon-ttw] : an extended autosave manager
* [Sortomatic](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/41142) [![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended]![Vortex][icon-ttw] : Mod tool to enable sorting items in player homes.
  * [Sortomatic Ingredient Loader](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65921) [![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended]![Vortex][icon-ttw] : Mod tool that, basically, loads item components from mods to propagate workbench lists.
  * [TTW DLC Sortomatic Homes](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/65988) [![Tale of Two Wastelands][icon-ttw]][ttw-recommended]![Vortex][icon-ttw] : Sortomatic added to homes in specific DLC across both wastelands.
  * [Sortomatic DLC and TTW Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/66986)![Vortex][icon-ttw] : Not 100% sure, but it came recommended and doesn't seem harmful.

Broken
======
* [Sortomatic - Lucky 38](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57881) : Doesn't clear present objects properly, most likely due to TTW's usage of object IDs. Not going to work, might be overwriting some objects with those IDs (who knows where?). DO NOT USE.
* [TTW Player Housing Sortomatic](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/63501) : Built for TTW 2.x, relies on a deadlinked patch for 2.x, expected not to work with TTW 3.x even if it was there. Will give you a pink screen and an error message if you install it. Sorry kids.
